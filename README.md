### About NYC WiFi HotSpots Locator

NYC WiFi HotSpots Locator is an application which geolocates a user, and which can locate nearby WiFi HotSpots according to user-input zip code. The application is provided as a response to front-end engineering challenge from [###].

The challenge:

1) Please visit: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Wi-Fi-Hotspot-Locations/yjub-udmw

2) Utilizing the API available (https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/24t3-xqyv), build an application that gives you the five NEAREST wi-fi hotspots depending on the postcode you enter. You can use something like this tool: https://www.geodatasource.com/developers/javascript for this calculation. You will need to utilize the latitude and longitude information provided in the file.

3) Please make sure to utilize a mapping API such as Google Maps to indicate the location.

4) Please feel free to display the results in any way that you think might be aesthetically pleasing and intuitive. Also feel free to add anything to this project that might showcase your UX/Development expertise.

Part II: Commit your codebase to GitHub and provide a link

Please include README which also explains:
1. How to install and run your project
2. What design choices you made, and why.
3. If you had the option, what frame/libraries work you would use and not use and why.

============================================================


### How to install and run this project:

1. Clone repo
2. In your local project directory, run 'npm install', then 'npm start'
	- Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
	- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### If you had the option, what frame/libraries work you would use and not use and why.

To put this concisely: I've been learning React (in the midst of a React course) and this challenge seemed an ideal opportunity to apply what I've learned so far and to stretch my knowledge of React. Indeed, it has been illuminating!


### What design choices you made, and why.
As I've been a html/css dev for quite some time I'm quite comfortable creating my own structure and classes, and typically eschew using design frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Foundation) where they're not already in use. However in this case, and again, because semantic-ui has been useful for other apps built in the React course, I opted to use it here as well. Of course the 'design' here is pretty simple but that works for my minimalist taste.
